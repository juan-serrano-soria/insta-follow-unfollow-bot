# insta-follow-unfollow-bot

Bot created for a spanish industrial engineering job fair's official instagram account.

## What does it have to do
The fair social media team wants to build up their instagram account.
They have gathered some instagram accounts related to different branches of engineering, and they have organized them in groups.

Each day they want to follow the followers of each "engineering" group of accounts.
Three days later, they want to unfollow these accounts (the ones who where public or accepted).

They want to keep on doing this cycle of following and unfollowing.

## How to use it  
*following.py* (Under construction) receives a file containing the accounts to follow, and follows them.  

*generate_following_list.py* (Under construction) takes a file containing the accounts of an "engineering group", grabs their followers, removes duplicates and saves these accounts in another file.  

*unfollowing.py* (Under construction) takes a file containing the accounts followed, and unfollows the ones who didn't follow back.  

  
### Disclaimer: 
Instagram may (most-certainly to be honest) apply soft bans to your account if you use this.
